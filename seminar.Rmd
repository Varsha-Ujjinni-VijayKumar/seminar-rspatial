# Introduction to [Rspatialdata](https://rspatialdata.github.io/)

- Open and reliable data, analytical tools and collaborative research are crucial for solving global challenges and achieving sustainable development.

--

- Spatial and spatio-temporal data are used in a wide range of fields including health, social and environmental disciplines to improve the evaluation and monitoring of goals both within and across countries.

--

- To facilitate the increasing need to easily access reliable spatial data using R, many R packages have been recently developed as clients for various spatial databases and repositories.

--

- To make it known and easier for people looking to work with spatial data.

# Administrative Boundaries 

- Administrative Boundaries can be taken from `rgeoboundaries` package for data and visualisation.

- It has functions like `geoboundaries()` which can be used to retrieve the administrative boundaries of different regions and can be visualised using the `ggplot2` package.   

- Example: 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height=300,out.width=350,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("2021-03-08.png")
```

# Open Street Map 

- `osmdata` package provides spatial data about a wide range of spatial properties and objects across the world. 

- 

- Example: 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height=300,out.width=350,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("osm.png")
```
