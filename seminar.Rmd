# About KAUST`r emo::ji("school")`

We spent our summer vacation as visiting students at **KAUST**(King Abdullah University of Science and Technology), remotely.  

**Visiting Student Program**

-  is an exciting opportunity aimed at offering research experience for highly qualified and motivated international students.

-  Collaborate with their faculty in world-class facilities.


Our supervisor was the awesome [Dr.Paula Moraga](https://www.paulamoraga.com/), who is an assistant professor at KAUST.

# Introduction to [Rspatialdata](https://rspatialdata.github.io/)`r emo::ji("milky_way")`

- Open and reliable data, analytical tools and collaborative research are crucial for solving global challenges and achieving sustainable development.

--

- Spatial and spatio-temporal data are used in a wide range of fields including health, social and environmental disciplines to improve the evaluation and monitoring of goals both within and across countries.

--

- To facilitate the increasing need to easily access reliable spatial data using R, many R packages have been recently developed as clients for various spatial databases and repositories.

--

- To make it known and easier for people looking to work with spatial data.

# Administrative Boundaries 

- Administrative Boundaries can be taken from `rgeoboundaries` package for data and visualisation.

- It has functions like `geoboundaries()` which can be used to retrieve the administrative boundaries of different regions and can be visualised using the `ggplot2` package.   

- Example: 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height=300,out.width=350,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("2021-03-08.png")
```

---

# Open Street Map 

- `osmdata` package provides spatial data about a wide range of spatial properties and objects across the world. 

- 

- Example: 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height=300,out.width=350,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("osm.png")
```

---

# Population

-

-

- Example: 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height=300,out.width=350,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("pop.png")
```
---

# Elevation

- `elevatr` package for a standardized access to the elevation data from the web. 

- It takes values from either the USGS elevation point query service (for United States) and Amazon Web services terrain tiles (global elevation data).

- Functions used to get the elevation data are `get_elev_point()`- to get the point elevations and `get_elev_raster()` - it gives the elevation data as a raster.

- Example: 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height=300,out.width=350,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("ele.png")
```

---

# Temperature

-

-

- Example: 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height=300,out.width=350,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("temp.png")
```

---

# Rainfall

- `nasapower` package aims at making it quick and easy to automate downloading NASA POWER global ,meteorological, surface solar energy using `get_power()`.

- The argument `pars` is set to **PRECTOT** to get the precipitation dataset.

- We can get previous years data either *daily*,*interannual* and *climatology*(30 year period). 

- Example: 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height=300,out.width=350,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("rain.png")
```

---

# Humidity

- Again `nasapower` package is used for retrieving the humidity values.

- Function used `get_power()` function with the argument `pars` as **RH2M** to get the data for Relative Humidity at 2 meters.

- Example: 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height=300,out.width=350,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("humid.png")
```

???
- Climatology is used for the whole world data

- 
---

# Vegetation

-

-

- Example: 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height=300,out.width=350,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("veg.png")
```


---

# Malaria

- The `malariaAtlas` package to download, visualise and manipulate global malaria data hosted by the [**Malaria Atlas Project**](https://malariaatlas.org/).

- Functions usable are `getPR()`,`getVecOcc()`, `getShp()` and `getRaster()` for getting data for malaria. 

- Functions for visualising these datasets is by using `autoplot()`. 

- Example: 

```{r echo=FALSE,out.height=300,out.width=350,fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("malaria.png")
```
